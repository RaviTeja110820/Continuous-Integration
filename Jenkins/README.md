# 🧩 Jenkins

---

## 🔰 1. What is Jenkins?

Jenkins is an **open‑source automation server** used to automate every stage of the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**:

* 🏗️ Build
* 🧪 Test
* 🚀 Deploy
* 🔄 Operations
* 📊 Monitoring

Jenkins is mainly used for **CI/CD pipelines (Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment)**.

But remember:

👉 **Jenkins itself does NOT perform technical tasks like building, testing, or deploying.**
It works as an **orchestrator** — coordinating tools that actually do the work.

---

## ❌ 2. What Jenkins CANNOT Do

Jenkins cannot:

* Compile code
* Test code
* Deploy code
* Review code
* Perform code coverage
* Perform monitoring
* Create infrastructure

Why?

➡️ Because Jenkins is just an **automation coordinator**.
Actual work is done by external tools.

---

## 🔗 3. Jenkins as an Integrator (Orchestrator)

Jenkins integrates with almost every DevOps tool using **plugins**.

Below is the list of integrations across SDLC stages:

### 🧩 A. Version Control Integration

To fetch source code:

* Git
* GitHub
* GitLab
* Bitbucket
* SVN

### 🧩 B. Build Tool Integration

To compile & package code:

* Maven
* Gradle
* Ant
* MSBuild
* PyBuilder

### 🧩 C. Deployment Tools Integration

To deploy applications:

* Ansible
* Docker
* Kubernetes
* Helm
* Terraform (for infra provisioning indirectly)

### 🧩 D. Security & Code Analysis Tools

For scanning & code analysis:

* SonarQube
* Snyk
* Veracode
* OWASP Dependency Check
* PMD

### 🧩 E. Testing Tools Integration

For continuous testing:

* Selenium
* TestNG
* JUnit
* PyTest
* Cucumber
* NUnit

### 🧩 F. Monitoring Tools Integration

For monitoring & health checks:

* Prometheus
* Grafana
* NewRelic
* Datadog

### 🧩 G. Reporting & Notification Tools

For communication & reports:

* HTML reports
* JUnit reports
* Slack
* Email
* Microsoft Teams

## ⚙️ 4. Why Plugins Are Important in Jenkins

Jenkins is **plugin‑based**.

A plugin = an extension that adds capabilities.

Examples:

* **Git plugin** → fetch code
* **Docker plugin** → build & run containers
* **Kubernetes plugin** → deploy to clusters
* **SonarQube plugin** → code scanning
* **Email plugin** → send notifications

👉 Without plugins, Jenkins is almost **empty**.

---

## 🔑 5. Key Features of Jenkins

✔ Platform independent — runs on:

* Windows
* Linux
* macOS
* Docker containers
* Kubernetes clusters

✔ Free & open-source
✔ Very easy to install
✔ Works on VMs, EC2, on-prem, containers
✔ Secure — supports RBAC, credentials, LDAP, API tokens
✔ Extensible — **1800+ plugins**

---

## ☕ 6. Jenkins Requires Java

Jenkins is a **Java‑based application**.

You must install:

* **Java 17 (Recommended LTS)**
* Java 21 (also supported)

➡️ Without Java, Jenkins will NOT start.

---

## 🔄 7. What Jenkins Actually Does

Jenkins performs orchestration tasks:

✔ Schedules jobs (manual/automatic)
✔ Triggers pipelines on:

* Code push
* Pull request
* Merge
* Commit
* Cron schedule
* Manual trigger

✔ Calls other tools:

* Build → Maven
* Test → Selenium
* Deploy → Ansible
* Monitor → Prometheus

✔ Tracks logs & job results
✔ Generates reports
✔ Sends notifications

---

## 🚀 8. Why Jenkins Is Mainly Used

Jenkins automates **CI/CD pipelines**, enabling:

### CI → Continuous Integration

* Automatic code fetch
* Build
* Testing
* Packaging

### CD → Continuous Deployment

* Automated deployment
* Post-deployment monitoring

This provides:

* Faster delivery
* Reliable builds
* Reduced manual work
* Fewer human errors
* Full DevOps automation

# 🏗️ Installing Jenkins on an EC2 Server

### A Complete & Beginner‑Friendly Guide

Jenkins can run on Windows, macOS, or Linux, but the **most recommended setup** for DevOps learning and production is **Jenkins on a Linux EC2 instance (Ubuntu/Debian)**.

This guide explains:

* EC2 requirements
* Java installation
* Jenkins installation
* Service configuration
* Accessing Jenkins UI
* Security group setup

---

## 1️⃣ EC2 System Requirements for Jenkins

Jenkins is lightweight, but plugins + builds consume RAM and CPU.

**Recommended instance types:**

| Instance Type | RAM  | CPU    | Recommendation          |
| ------------- | ---- | ------ | ----------------------- |
| **t2.medium** | 4 GB | 2 vCPU | ✔ Ideal for Jenkins     |
| **t2.small**  | 2 GB | 1 vCPU | ⚠ May freeze under load |
| **t3.medium** | 4 GB | 2 vCPU | ✔ Better performance    |

### 📌 Why `t2.medium`?

* Jenkins + plugins need at least **4 GB RAM**
* Java is memory‑heavy
* Build tools (Maven, Gradle) need CPU

---

## 2️⃣ Install Java (Required for Jenkins)

Jenkins requires **Java 17** or **Java 21**.

### Update system packages:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

### Install Java 21:

```bash
sudo apt install openjdk-21-jre-headless -y
```

### Verify Java version:

```bash
java -version
```

Expected output example:

```
openjdk version "21.0.1" 2023-10-17
```

---

## 3️⃣ Install Jenkins (Debian/Ubuntu)

📌 Always follow the official guide:
[https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/#debianubuntu](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/#debianubuntu)

Below are the exact official steps.

### 🧩 Step 1 — Add Jenkins GPG key

```bash
sudo wget -O /etc/apt/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
```

### 🧩 Step 2 — Add Jenkins repository

```bash
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
```

### 🧩 Step 3 — Update system packages

```bash
sudo apt update
```

### 🧩 Step 4 — Install Jenkins

```bash
sudo apt install jenkins -y
```

---

## 4️⃣ Start & Enable Jenkins

### Start Jenkins service:

```bash
sudo systemctl start jenkins
```

### Enable Jenkins on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
```

### Check status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status jenkins
```

Expected: **active (running)**

---

## 5️⃣ Access Jenkins Web UI

Open a browser and enter:

```
http://<EC2-Public-IP>:8080
```

Example:

```
http://54.220.10.45:8080
```

---

## 6️⃣ Retrieve Jenkins Initial Admin Password

Run:

```bash
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```

Copy the password and paste it into the Jenkins setup wizard.

Then:

* Install suggested plugins
* Create admin user
* Complete setup

---

## 7️⃣ Firewall / Security Group Rules

Open port 8080 in your EC2 security group:

| Port | Protocol | Description |
| ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| 8080 | TCP      | Jenkins UI  |
| 22   | TCP      | SSH access  |

---

## 8️⃣ ✔️ Verify Jenkins is Listening on Port 8080 (`ss -tunlp`)

After installation, confirm that the Jenkins Java process is **listening on port 8080**.

Run:

```bash
ss -tunlp | grep 8080
```

Example Output:

```
tcp   LISTEN 0    100   0.0.0.0:8080    0.0.0.0:*   users:(("java",pid=1234,fd=45))
tcp   LISTEN 0    100   [::]:8080       [::]:*      users:(("java",pid=1234,fd=45))
```

Meaning:

* **LISTEN** → Jenkins server is actively running
* **java** → Jenkins is a Java application
* **8080** → Default Jenkins port
* **pid=1234** → Jenkins process ID

This confirms Jenkins is successfully running and reachable on port 8080.

# ⚡ Jenkins Triggers

Jenkins **Triggers** allow jobs to run automatically without clicking **Build Now**.
They help automate CI/CD pipelines by reacting to **events**, **time schedules**, **API calls**, and more.

Jenkins provides **4 commonly used triggers**.

---

# 🔹 1. Trigger Builds Remotely (via URL / curl / scripts)

This trigger allows starting a Jenkins job from:

* Browser URL
* curl command
* External automation tools

## ✅ Steps

### **Step 1 — Enable Remote Trigger**

1. Open Job → Configure
2. Go to **Build Triggers**
3. Select: **Trigger builds remotely (e.g., from scripts)**
4. Enter a token, e.g.: `token1`

### **Step 2 — Jenkins Generates Trigger URL**

Format:

```
JENKINS_URL/job/<JOB_NAME>/build?token=<TOKEN_NAME>
```

Example:

```
Jenkins URL: http://3.140.252.165:8080
Job Name: job4
Token: token1
```

Final URL:

```
http://3.140.252.165:8080/job/job4/build?token=token1
```

Open this URL → The job runs automatically.

### **Step 3 — Trigger Remotely Using curl**

You need your Jenkins **User API Token**.

#### 🔑 How to get API Token:

Jenkins Dashboard → User → Configure → API Token → **Generate New Token**

Suppose token = `abc123xyz`

Run:

```bash
curl -l -u admin:abc123xyz http://3.140.252.165:8080/job/CloneRepo/build?token=token1
```

This triggers the job **remotely and without password**.

---

# 🔹 2. GitHub Hook Trigger for GITScm Polling (Best for CI)

This automatically builds the job when a GitHub push occurs.

## Step 1 — Enable Webhook Trigger in Jenkins

Job → Configure → Build Triggers → Select:

```
GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling
```

Save the job.

⚠️ IMPORTANT: **Always save the job before adding GitHub webhook.**

## Step 2 — Configure Webhook in GitHub

1. Go to GitHub Repo → **Settings** → **Webhooks**
2. Remove old webhooks if any
3. Click **Add Webhook**

Fill the details:

* **Payload URL:**

```
http://3.140.252.165:8080/github-webhook/
```

* **Content Type:** `application/json`
* **Secret:** leave empty
* **Events:** *Just the push event*
* Active ✔

Click **Add Webhook**.

## Step 3 — Push Code to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "trigger test"
git push
```

📌 Jenkins automatically starts a build → **True CI**.

---

# 🔹 3. Build Periodically (CRON Syntax)

Runs the job at scheduled intervals.

Example: **Run every 2 minutes**

1. Job → Configure → Build Triggers
2. Select **Build periodically**
3. Enter:

```
*/2 * * * *
```

✔ Jenkins builds every 2 minutes.

---

# 🔹 4. Poll SCM (Check Git repo periodically)

This checks GitHub (or any repo) on a schedule, and triggers build **only if code changed**.

Steps:

1. Job → Configure → Add Git repo under **Source Code Management**
2. Build Triggers → Select: **Poll SCM**
3. Enter CRON expression:

```
* * * * *
```

Meaning:
✔ Check repo every 1 minute
✔ Build only when changes exist

---

# 🔍 Poll SCM vs GitHub Webhook

| Feature           | GitHub Webhook    | Poll SCM                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Triggered by      | GitHub push event | Jenkins polling schedule           |
| Immediate?        | ✔ Instant         | ✖ Depends on cron                  |
| Load on Jenkins   | Very Low          | High                               |
| Internet Required | Yes               | No (works with local Git)          |
| Recommended?      | ⭐ YES             | Use only when webhook not possible |

---

# 📘 Summary Table of All Jenkins Triggers

| Trigger                 | Used For                     | Example                           |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Remote Trigger**      | Start job through URL/curl   | `curl .../build?token=token1`     |
| **GitHub Hook Trigger** | Auto-build on Git push       | Push → Jenkins builds             |
| **Build Periodically**  | Scheduled builds             | `*/2 * * * *`                     |
| **Poll SCM**            | Build only when repo changes | Check every min, build on changes |

# Jenkins Integration with Build Tools

## Introduction

Jenkins is an **automation and orchestration tool** used to automate different stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
However, **Jenkins alone cannot compile, test, or package code**.
To perform these tasks, Jenkins integrates with **Build Automation Tools**.

---

## Why Build Tools Are Required

When working with application source code (Java, .NET, Python, Node.js, etc.), we usually need to:

- Compile the code
- Run unit and integration tests
- Package the application (JAR, WAR, ZIP, etc.)
- Review code quality
- Check code coverage

➡ Jenkins cannot perform these operations by itself.

---

## Role of Build Automation Tools

Build tools are responsible for:

- Compiling source code
- Resolving dependencies
- Running automated tests
- Packaging applications
- Generating test and coverage reports

### Common Build Tools by Language

| Language | Build Tool |
|--------|-----------|
| Java | Maven, Gradle, Ant |
| .NET / C# | MSBuild |
| Node.js | NPM / Yarn |
| Python | Interpreter-based (no compilation) |

---

## Important Note on Python

Python is an **interpreted language**, so:

- No compilation is required
- Code is executed directly using the Python interpreter
- Testing is done using tools like:
  - pytest
  - unittest
  - nose

In Jenkins pipelines, Python jobs usually:
- Install dependencies (`pip install`)
- Run tests
- Execute the application

---

## Jenkins as an Orchestrator

Jenkins does **NOT**:
- Compile code
- Test code
- Package code
- Perform code review
- Generate coverage reports

Jenkins **ORCHESTRATES** these tasks by integrating with other tools.

### Typical Jenkins Flow

```
Jenkins Job
   ↓
Fetch code from GitHub
   ↓
Trigger build tool
   ↓
Build tool runs commands
   ↓
Output displayed in Jenkins console
```

---

## Jenkins Integration with Build Tools

Jenkins integrates with build tools in two main ways:

### 1. Using Jenkins Plugins

Jenkins is a **plugin-based tool**.

Common plugins:
- Maven Integration Plugin
- Gradle Plugin
- NodeJS Plugin

---

### 2. Using Shell / Batch Commands

Jenkins can execute build commands using:
- **Execute Shell** (Linux)
- **Execute Windows Batch Command** (Windows)

#### Examples

**Java (Maven):**
```
mvn clean install
```

**Node.js:**
```
npm install
npm test
```

**Python:**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest
```

**.NET:**
```
msbuild MyApp.sln
```

---

## Build Tool Setup in Jenkins

For Jenkins to work with build tools, they must be configured.

### Path:
```
Manage Jenkins → Global Tool Configuration
```

Configure:
- JDK
- Maven
- Gradle
- NodeJS

---

## Example Jenkins Job Flow

```
Developer pushes code to GitHub
        ↓
Jenkins job starts
        ↓
Jenkins pulls code from GitHub
        ↓
Jenkins triggers build tool
        ↓
Build tool compiles/tests/packages code
        ↓
Results shown in Jenkins console
```

---

## Key Takeaways

- Jenkins is NOT a build tool
- Jenkins is an automation/orchestration server
- Build tools perform compilation, testing, and packaging
- Jenkins integrates with build tools using plugins or shell commands
- Python does not require compilation
- Build tools must be configured before running Jenkins jobs

---




# Maven + Jenkins – Build Pipeline Explanation

## 1. What is a Pipeline?

A **Pipeline** is a set of tasks executed one after another in a defined sequence to achieve a goal.

In DevOps, a pipeline usually represents the:
- Compile
- Test
- Review
- Coverage
- Package

The tool used to **orchestrate and automate pipelines** is **Jenkins**.

---

## 2. SDLC Context – Build Stage

Once a developer pushes code to GitHub/GitLab, the next SDLC stage is **BUILD**.

BUILD is not a single step. It includes:
- Compiling the code
- Running unit tests
- Reviewing code quality
- Checking code coverage
- Packaging the application

Executing these steps in sequence forms a **Build Pipeline**.

---

## 3. Why Build Automation Tools Are Needed

Jenkins **cannot**:
- Compile code
- Test code
- Package applications

To perform these tasks, Jenkins integrates with **Build Automation Tools**.

One such powerful build tool is **MAVEN**.

---

## 4. What is Maven?

Maven is:
- A build automation tool
- Mainly used for Java projects
- Simple, powerful, and widely adopted

Java developers write code in a structure that Maven understands.

---

## 5. What Developers Provide

Java developers usually provide:
1. Java source code
2. Unit test cases (JUnit)

This code is pushed to GitHub/GitLab and handed over to the DevOps team.

---

## 6. Maven Build Steps and Plugins

| Build Step | Maven Plugin | Command |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Clean old builds | Clean Plugin | mvn clean |
| Compile code | Compiler Plugin | mvn compile |
| Run tests | Surefire Plugin | mvn test |
| Package app | Jar/War Plugin | mvn package |

Maven downloads and executes these plugins automatically.

---

## 7. Maven Output – Target Folder

- Maven generates a **target/** folder
- All build outputs (JAR/WAR, reports) are stored here
- The target folder is created automatically by Maven

---

## 8. Maven Repositories

Maven downloads plugins and dependencies from repositories.

### Types:
1. **Central Repository** – Public Maven repo
2. **Remote Repository** – Organization-level repo (Nexus/Artifactory)
3. **Local Repository** – Local machine repo
   - Default location:
     ```
     ~/.m2/repository
     ```

Deciding repository locations is the **developer’s responsibility**.

---

## 9. Plugins and Versions Responsibility

- DevOps engineers do NOT decide plugin versions
- Developers define plugins and versions in **pom.xml**

---

## 10. POM.xml – Heart of Maven

POM = Project Object Model

- Mandatory for every Maven project
- Without pom.xml, Maven cannot build the project

POM.xml defines:
- Build plugins
- Plugin versions
- Repository URLs
- Dependencies for application and tests

---

## 11. Standard Maven Project Structure

```
project-root/
├── src/
│   ├── main/java/     (Application code)
│   └── test/java/     (Unit tests)
├── pom.xml
```

---

## 12. Maven Plugin Documentation

Official site:
https://maven.apache.org/plugins/

---

## 13. Manual Maven Build (Not Recommended)

Steps:
1. Clone repo
2. Install Maven
3. Run:
   ```
   mvn compile
   mvn test
   mvn package
   ```

Problems:
- Manual effort
- Error-prone
- No automation

---

## 14. Automating Maven Using Jenkins

Jenkins enables **Continuous Integration (CI)**.

### Flow:
```
Developer commits code
        ↓
Jenkins pulls code
        ↓
Jenkins triggers Maven
        ↓
Maven builds application
        ↓
Output generated
```

---

## 15. Jenkins Workspace and Maven Output

- Jenkins workspace:
  ```
  /var/lib/jenkins/workspace
  ```

- Maven output:
  ```
  /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/JOB_NAME/target/
  ```

---

## 16. Jenkins + Maven Integration Setup

Steps:
1. Jenkins Dashboard
2. Manage Jenkins
3. Global Tool Configuration
4. Maven:
   - Name: mymaven
   - Enable: Install automatically
5. Save

Jenkins can now run Maven builds automatically.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Maven is a build automation tool
- Jenkins is a pipeline orchestrator
- Developers control pom.xml
- Jenkins triggers Maven builds
- Output is stored in target folder
- Builds are fully automated

---

* Goals:

```
compile
```

### Build & Verify

* Save → **Build Now**
* Check Console Output
* Look for line similar to:

```
Compiling 13 source files to /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/compile/target/classes
```

### Output Location

```
/var/lib/jenkins/workspace/compile/target/classes
```

This confirms **successful compilation**.

---

## Job 2: Code Review (Static Code Analysis using PMD)

### Purpose

* Detects **coding standard violations**
* Identifies bad practices, unused variables, complexity issues

> PMD performs **static analysis** (no code execution).

### Create Job

1. Jenkins → New Item
2. Job name: `code-review`
3. Select **Freestyle project**

### Source Code Management

* Git Repository:

```
https://github.com/Sonal0409/DevOpsCodeDemo.git
```

### Build Step

* Build → Invoke top-level Maven targets
* Maven version: `mymaven`
* Goals:

```
pmd:pmd
```

### Output

* Build generates PMD report at:

```
target/pmd.xml
```

---

## Converting PMD Output to Trend Report (Warnings Plugin)

### Install Plugin

* Manage Jenkins → Plugins → Available
* Search: **Warnings Next Generation Plugin**
* Install and restart Jenkins

### Configure Post Build Action

* Job → Configure → Post-build Actions

* Goals:

```
test
```

### Output

JUnit test results stored at:

```
target/surefire-reports/*.xml
```

---

## Generating Readable Test Reports

### Why?

Raw XML is hard to understand → Jenkins converts it into visual reports.

### Configure Post Build Action

* Job → Configure → Post-build Actions
* Select **Publish JUnit test result report**

Test report XML path:

```
target/surefire-reports/*.xml
```

### Result

* Build again

```

### Output

WAR file generated at:

```
/var/lib/jenkins/workspace/package/target/addressbook.war
```

This WAR file is used for **deployment** (Tomcat, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.).

---

## Overall CI Flow (Freestyle Jobs)

```
GitHub Commit
     ↓
Jenkins Fetch Code
     ↓
Compile Job
     ↓
Code Review (PMD)
     ↓
Unit Testing (JUnit)
     ↓
Package (WAR)
```

---

## Key Corrections & Notes

* Jenkins **does not build code itself** → Maven does
* PMD is for **static analysis**, not testing
* JUnit reports must be explicitly published
* `target/` directory is **always generated by Maven**
* Freestyle jobs are good for learning; pipelines are preferred in real projects
